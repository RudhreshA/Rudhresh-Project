    <p>ABOUT ANIMALS ; Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia.
         With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes
          and are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula,
           during embryonic development. As of 2022, 
           2.16 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1.05 million are insects,
            over 85,000 are molluscs, and around 65,000 are vertebrates—but it has been estimated there are around 7.77 million animal species 
            in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft).
             They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs
        . The scientific study of animals is known as zoology.</p>

    <p>ABOUT BIRDS ;Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves (/ˈeɪviːz/), characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds.
         Wings, which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight.
          Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming. 
          The study of birds is called ornithology. </p>

    <p>ABOUT CARNIVORS ;The technical term for mammals in the order Carnivora is carnivoran, and they are so-named because most member species in the group have a carnivorous diet, but the similarity of the name of the order and the name of the diet causes confusion.

        Many but not all carnivorans are meat eaters; a few, such as the large and small cats (felidae) are obligate carnivores (see below). Other classes of carnivore are highly variable. The Ursids, for example: While the Arctic polar bear eats meat almost exclusively (more than 90% of its diet is meat), almost all other bear species are omnivorous, and one species, the giant panda, is nearly exclusively herbivorous.[3]
        
        Dietary carnivory is not a distinguishing trait of the order: Many mammals with highly carnivorous diets are not members of the order Carnivora. Cetaceans, for example, all eat other animals, but are paradoxically members of the almost exclusively plant-eating hooved mammals.
